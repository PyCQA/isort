### 5.0.0 Penny - July 4, 2020
**Breaking changes:**

  - isort now requires Python 3.6+ to run but continues to support formatting on ALL versions of python including
    Python 2 code.
  - isort deprecates official support for Python 3.4, removing modules only in this release from known_standard_library:
      - user
  - Config files are no longer composed on-top of each-other. Instead the first config file found is used.
    - Since there is no longer composition negative form settings (such as --dont-skip or it's config file variant `not_skip`) are no longer required and have been removed.
  - Two-letter shortened setting names (like `ac` for `atomic`) now require two dashes to avoid ambiguity: `--ac`.
  - For consistency with other tools `-v` now is shorthand for verbose and `-V` is shorthand for version. See Issue: #1067.
  - `length_sort_{section_name}` config usage has been deprecated. Instead `length_sort_sections` list can be used to specify a list of sections that need to be length sorted.
  - `safety_excludes` and `unsafe` have been deprecated
  - Config now includes as default full set of safety directories defined by safety excludes.
  - `--recursive` option has been removed. Directories passed in are now automatically sorted recursive.
  - `--apply` option has been removed as it is the default behaviour.
  - isort now does nothing, beyond giving instructions and exiting status code 0, when ran with no arguments.
    - a new `--interactive` flag has been added to enable the old style behaviour.
  - isort now works on contiguous sections of imports, instead of one whole file at a time.
  - ~~isort now formats all nested "as" imports in the "from" form. `import x.y as a` becomes `from x import y as a`.~~ NOTE: This was undone in version 5.1.0 due to feedback it caused issues with some project conventions.
  - `keep_direct_and_as_imports` option now defaults to `True`.
  - `appdirs` is no longer supported. Unless manually specified, config should be project config only.
  - `toml` is now installed as a vendorized module, meaning pyproject.toml based config is always supported.
  - Completely new Python API, old version is removed and no longer accessible.
  - New module placement logic and module fully replaces old finders. Old approach is still available via `--old-finders`.

Internal:

  - isort now utilizes mypy and typing to filter out typing related issues before deployment.
  - isort now utilizes black internally to ensure more consistent formatting.

- profile support for common project types (black, django, google, etc)

- Much much more. There is some difficulty in fully capturing the extent of changes in this release - just because of how all encompassing the release is. See: [Github Issues](https://github.com/pycqa/isort/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) for more.

### 4.3.5 - February 24, 2019 - last Python 2.7 Maintenance Release

This is the final Python 2.x release of isort, and includes the following major changes:

Potentially Interface Breaking:
- The `-r` option for removing imports has been renamed `-rm` to avoid accidental deletions and confusion with the `-rc` recursive option.
- `__init__.py` has been removed from the default ignore list. The default ignore list is now empty - with all items needing to be explicitly ignored.
- Isort will now by default ignore .tox / venv folders in an effort to be "safe". You can disable this behaviour by setting the "--unsafe" flag, this is separate from any skip or not skip rules you may have in place.
- Isort now allows for files missing closing newlines in whitespace check
- `distutils` support has been removed to simplify setup.py

New:
- Official Python 3.7 Compatibility.
- Support for using requirements files to auto determine third-paty section if pipreqs & requirementslib are installed.
- Added support for using pyproject.toml if toml is installed.
- Added support for XDG_HOME if appdirs is installed.
- An option has been added to enable ignoring trailing comments ('ignore_comments') defaulting to False.
- Added support to enable line length sorting for only specific sections
- Added a `correctly_sorted` property on the SortsImport to enable more intuitive programmatic checking.

Fixes:
- Improved black compatibility.
- Isort will now detect files in the CWD as first-party.
- Fixed several cases where '-ns' or 'not_skip' was being incorrectly ignored.
- Fixed sorting of relative path imports ('.', '..', '...', etc).
- Fixed bugs caused by a failure to maintain order when loading iterables from config files.
- Correctly handle CPython compiled imports and others that need EXT_SUFFIX to correctly identify.
- Fixed handling of Symbolic Links to follow them when walking the path.
- Fixed handling of relative known_paths.
- Fixed lack of access to all wrap modes from the CLI.
- Fixed handling of FIFO files.
- Fixed a bug that could result in multiple imports being inserted on the same line.
